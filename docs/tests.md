# Integration tests

This repository contains multiple test suites, each with its own purpose:
- [Functions](): tests that functions lifecycle (`serverless deploy` and `serverless remove`) works properly.
- [Containers](): tests that container lifecycle (`serverless deploy` and `serverless remove`) works properly.
- [Runtimes](): tests that our runtimes work properly by using the [examples]() we provide to use our platform.

## Requirements

To run your tests locally, you have to make sure of the following:
- You have docker installed (and usable from your Command Line)
- You have [Serverless CLI](https://github.com/serverless/serverless) installed (and usable from your Command Line)
- You have access to Scaleway Function's Product and Scaleway Container Registry (and still have quotas available).
- You have a Scaleway Account

## How to run tests

### Configuration

In order to run tests locally, you have to configure your test suite (for `authentication`).

To do so, I recommend following the [guide on how to retrieve a token and your project ID](https://github.com/scaleway/serverless-scaleway-functions/blob/master/docs/README.md).

Then, add it to your environment variables:
```bash
export SCW_TOKEN=<scw-token>
export SCW_PROJECT=<scw-project>
```

Optionally, you may change the URL of our `functions` API endpoint (if you need to test different environments for example):
```bash
export SCW_URL=<url-to-functions-api>
```

### Run Tests

We provided multiple test suites, as described above, with the following `npm` scripts:

- `npm run test`: Run all test suites
- `npm run test:functions`: Run functions's test suite
- `npm run test:containers`: Run containers's test suite
- `npm run test:runtimes`: Run runtimes's test suite
- `npm run test -- -t "Some test regex*"`: Runs all tests matching the regex

These tests use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/) under the hood.

**Also, make sure that you did not install this repository inside a `node_modules` folder, otherwhise your npm commands won't work (`no tests found`)**.

As these test suites imply real-time build/packaging of your functions/containers code and deployment to our platform, they take a bit of time (~3 minutes for functions/containers, and ~6 minutes for runtimes).
